Simple mod for RimWorld that completely removes lasso from Melee Animation mod.

Lasso items will be removed from the map and pawns inventory on map load and when new pawns spawn.
Lasso can't be crafted anymore.
Lasso will be not selled by traders (has zero market value).
Button with lasso modes was removed.
